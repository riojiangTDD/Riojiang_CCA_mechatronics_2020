# Week7-Avoid obstacle vehicle / remote control vehicle

During that week I completed the midterm project together with Stella, I mainly responsible for the car model making, circuit connection and the code of car steering and movement. Stella was responsible for writing the program for avoiding obstacles and remote control.

## 仇능hat i want to do 
I want to make a car that can avoid obstacles automatically. It looked like a sweeping robot, and in two weeks I had finished the assembly of the car and the coding of the motor part. In the ancient city of automobile assembly, I choose foam board as its chassis. Other parts I removed from other car models. Now it's a car that can move back and forth and left and right.

## 仇능hat i use
Arduino board 
Arduino sheild 
L298N motor drive 
DCMotor x 4
Ultrsonic sensor
Power switch 
Battery holder
Led light 

## Circuit 
Connect the Ultrasonic Sensor, Servo, and L298N to the Arduino Sensor Shield

Through the learning of Arduino, I want to make a traffic light controlled by code. The traffic light can simulate the process of waiting and flashing.

# Week3-Drawing machine

## 仇능hat i want to do 
For this drawing machine, I want to use the motor to drive the huge brush to draw. And I made this brush with lines of various colors to enrich the colors of the brush. So we can choose to any pigment you want to paint.

In the final work, I chose to use the traditional Chinese strip paper to allow the drawing machine to continuously draw images. When the drawing machine finished the work, I added my own words to form a work of human and machine. So I think that is kind of Human Computer Interaction
