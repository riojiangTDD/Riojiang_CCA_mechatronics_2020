# Week3-Drawing machine

## ❓what i want to do 
For this drawing machine, I want to use the motor to drive the huge brush to draw. And I made this brush with lines of various colors to enrich the colors of the brush. So we can choose to any pigment you want to paint.

In the final work, I chose to use the traditional Chinese strip paper to allow the drawing machine to continuously draw images. When the drawing machine finished the work, I added my own words to form a work of human and machine. So I think that is kind of Human Computer Interaction
