## Week 2
   
 What I interest project:   
   
   This project is about how to make a time machine! This DIY time control machine looks like a glove, and can "stop" any moving subject. First part of this video is about some demonstration and experiments, and second - about how to make this time machine, using Arduino, high-power LED and some tricky magic with soldering iron. You can use this for pranks and demonstration of stroboscopic effect.
